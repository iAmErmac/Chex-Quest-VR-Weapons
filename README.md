# Chex Quest VR Weapons

Chex Quest 3D weapon mod for Chex/Doom/Heretic/Hexen/Strife by Ermac (https://www.reddit.com/user/iAmErmac)

This is a 3D weapon mod to use with Chex Quest (GZDoom VR). By design, this mod should allow using Chex Quest weapons with other map-packs and gameplay mods in Doom/Heretic/Hexen/Strife as well which don't change the monsters and weapon system too much from the vanilla Doom/Heretic/Hexen/Chex/Strife etc.
